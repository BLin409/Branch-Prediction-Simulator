This program takes two command line argument.
First argument is the input file for trace.
Second argument is the ouput file for accuracy rate of different branch direction prediction schemes.

This program consists of following prediction schemes:
1. Always Taken
2. Always Not Taken
3. Bimodal Predictor with 1-Bit History
   -  with 7 different table size (8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 entries)
4. Bimodal Predictor with 2-Bit Saturating Counters
   -  with 7 different table size (8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 entries)
5. Gshare Predictor (table size of 1024 entries)
   -  with 9 different global register size range from 2 bits to 10 bits
6. Tournament Predictor
   -  table size of 1024 entries for both Bimodal Predictor and Gshare Predictor
   -  10-bit global register for Gshare Predictor
   
Output file is formatted accordingly.
